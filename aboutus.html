                The objective of College Information Management System is to allow the administrator of any organization the ability to edit
                and ﬁnd out the personal details of a student and allows the student to keep up to date his proﬁle. 
                It’ll also facilitate keeping all the records of students, such as their id, name, mailing address, phone number, DOB etc. 
                So, all the information about a student will be available in a few seconds. 
                Overall, it’ll make Student Information an easier job for the administrator and the student of any organization.

                        The main purpose of this project is to illustrate the requirements of the project College Information Management System and is intended to help any organization to maintain and manage personal data. 
                        It is a comprehensive project developed from the ground up to fulﬁl the needs of colleges as they guide their students. 
                        This integrated information management system connects daily operations in the college environment ranging from Attendance and grade management to communicational means among students and teachers. 
                        <br>
                        This reduces data error and ensures that information is always up-to-date throughout the college. 
                        It provides a single source of data repository for streamlining your processes and for all reporting purposes. 
                        It has a simple user interface and is intuitive. 
                        This insures that the users spend less time in learning the system and hence, increase their productivity.
                        Eﬃcient security features provide data privacy and hence, increase their productivity.
