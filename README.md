#### Using the various resources and tools we gathered along the way, we implemented the college Management system using some features that solve the current problems in the system such as a provision to edit the attendance and marks before locking it at the end.
#### There are different attributes of online teaching such as online attendance, time tables, grades etc.
#### Two sign up/in options for teachers and students.
